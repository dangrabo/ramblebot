A class project to exercise Java, JUnit, git, GitHub, and code-reading skills. Some shell methods were provided initially, but
the vast majority of logic was written and implemented on my own.

Ramblebot is a unigram word predictor written in Java that can be trained on any given set of text.
Using the Markov chain model, the bot can autoregressively predict words to
produce generated content in the style of the training text.
